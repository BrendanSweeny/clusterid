# ClusterID
A GUI tool for identifying charged species, particularly small metal and metal-oxide
clusters in a mass spectrum

## Usage
1. Elements are specified using the periodic table
2. A target mass corresponding to the unidentified peak(s) is specified
3. "Find Matches" computes charged particles whose mass match the target within the specified tolerance
4. Matched species can be added to the simulated mass spectrum by clicking the "Add" button in the corresponding row

### Alternatively
* A series of clusters can be found up to the specified max per atom (e.g. max atoms: 10 --> A<sub>10</sub>B<sub>10</sub>)
* Additional chemical species can be added to the simulated mass spectrum by adding the chemical formula to the "Chemical Formula" input field
